# MolGPT
In this work, we train small custom GPT on Moses and Guacamol dataset with next token prediction task. The model is then used for unconditional and conditional molecular generation. We compare our model with previous approaches on the Moses and Guacamol datasets. Saliency maps are obtained for interpretability using Ecco library.

- The processed Guacamol and MOSES datasets in csv format can be downloaded from this link:

To train the model, make sure you have the datasets' csv file in the same directory as the code files.

# Training

```
./train_moses.sh
```

```
./train_guacamol.sh
```

# Generation
